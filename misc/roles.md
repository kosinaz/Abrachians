# Roles

* Arthur (Sheriff): Checks one person each night for suspicious activity. He either finds the shrink ray crystals in the framer's or in the framed person's room with his crystal scanner.
* Duke (Doctor): Saves one person each night, preventing them from shrinking. He secretly pours anti-shrink serum in their food that lasts one day.
* Ruby (Investigator): Investigates one person each night for a clue to their role.
* Phil (Jailor): Chooses one person during the day to jail for the night. He uses a voice changer to stay hidden during the interrogation and uses the paralyzer mode of his phaser to neutralize the suspicious target for a week.
* Cindy (Medium): Speaks with all kidnapped people at night. She uses a low-range radiotelephone to communicate with the kidnapped people's hidden telephone.
* Erica (Godfather): Kidnaps someone each night. She uses a shrink ray gun to shrink her victims, trap them in her gun, take them to the basement, and finally expand them through the keyhole. She stores all the extra shrink ray crystals in the framer's room and never leaves any of them in her own room. When she sleeps she stores her gun in a hidden shelf which can be found by the investigator proving that she is a monster.
* Ben (Framer): Chooses one person to frame each night. He doesn't have a gun, so he leaves shrink ray crystals in their room to make them look suspicous.
