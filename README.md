## 10 Cliffhangers

### 1. An Unanswered Question

Ask a question and don't answer it.

* "Before I answer I need to know that I can trust you."
* "You'll know the answer once you get there."
* "Acces Denied. Level 3 Security Clearance Required."

### 2. A Loss

Take away a tangible thing or relationship of vital importance.

* "All channels of interplanetary communication have been suspended to prevent mass hysteria."
* "The entire moon is under strict quarantine. No spacecraft can enter or leave for an uncertain period of time."
* "Dr Banaszak disappeared. He was the only one who could tell who is human and who isn't."

### 3. Dangle A Carrot

Show something important but unreachable.

* "Leave me alone! I need some time to think through this mess."
